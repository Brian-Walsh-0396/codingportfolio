# Brian's Portfolio

## Background
I am an Implementation Specialist with experience in managing multiple projects simultaneously, ensuring timely delivery, and maintaining strong client relationships. My work at Automated Data Processing has taught me how to effectively manage client resources, troubleshoot issues, and deliver expert knowledge while minimizing disruptions. In my previous role at Mosyle, I provided remote technical support for iOS and macOS devices and reduced ticket response time by 25% through process improvements and implementation of new technologies. My experience at The First Academy as a Technology Intern has given me skills in providing tier one and two support for hardware, software, and networking issues to over 500 users.

## CS50 and Personal Projects
This repository contains projects from Harvard's CS50 Course and my personal projects. As a BAS in Supervision and Management graduate from Polk State College, I have developed skills in data analytics, data visualization, and computer repair, which I am applying to expand my knowledge through personal projects. I am particularly interested in theme parks, Dungeons and Dragons, and 3D printing (MSLA), and I incorporate these interests into my projects. This README file will provide information on the projects included and their purpose.
